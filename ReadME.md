# Full Stack Web-User(ChatBot) Messanger 
A Full Stack (FrontEnd and BackEnd) for a fully designed messanger which can
work as the popular apps like whats app and instagram the difference is that 
it is a ChatBot you are not going to talk here to real person but significant
talk more than a real person..

#How ??
The goal is to write scripts and webpages for a messanger which can have different
features as the login page,Forget Password Page,Sign up,User validation page and
many more features(Going to add)... I am deploying here front end of the website
and some features of the back end as the login page and users features.. And Working 
on the Machine Learning Models for the real time chat bot feature.. So enjoy until
than to these webpages only..
You need to have a XAMPP webserver(or i recommend because i have used it) In that
the mysql is need to have Database named as TalkActives and UsersData Table to run
the program fully and you also need to have put the whole repository in the xampp
server directory for linux it is (/root/opt/lampp/htdocs)..
If you want to read the code start with the index.html on the root directory and
than you can see for the specific line language. And For login directory you should
start with the signup.php page and follow along with the comments..
Don't judge me with the images and color. And If want to break it send me some cookies on mail(just kidding)
and play with cookies...
If i have not commented on any page except for(html and css) pages. Don't bother
if you didn't get the code or have any doubt on the code. You can always email
on: @mannjhariya@gmail.com or leave a comment in Github..
